if __name__ == '__main__':
    # We're going to adapt the code in the main section of bioinformatics_utilities
    # so that it performs the same kind of analysis on the ENTIRE short.inti1.97.fasta file.
    # Copy over that code and change it so that:
    #   The gene of interest is the last gene in the gene list
    #   Alignments are calculated against ALL the genes in short.inti1.97.fasta EXCEPT the last one.




    # Modify the above code to print out the average alignment score after the alignment information.



    # Let's modify the above code so that it writes the pairwise alignment scores to another file named
    # 'short_alignment_info.txt'

    

    # Now, make the following two changes:
    #   'short.inti1.97.fasta' -> 'inti1.97.fasta'
    #   'short_alignment_info.txt" -> 'alignment_info.txt'
