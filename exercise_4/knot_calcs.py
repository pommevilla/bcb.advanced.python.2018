    # Our goal is to write the following to an output file:
    #    
    #   Knot name, Seed Strands, Set Wirtinger Number
    #
    # The gauss_codes.txt file already contains the knot name and the Gauss code.
    # Write a for loop that reads through gauss_codes and writes the name and the Gauss code
    # to a file called "knot_info.txt".
    # Carefully look at the format of the file and pick the appropriate character to split on.

    # Verify that knot_info is being printed correctly.
    # Now, use the get_wirtinger_info function from calc_wirt to get the seed_strand set
    # and the Wirtinger number of the knot for each line.
    # Modify the print statement by removing the Gauss code and adding the seed strands
    # and the Wirtinger number.
